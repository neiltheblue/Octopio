### Additional webcam devices known to cause problems with -f
#
# Apparently there a some devices out there that with the current
# mjpg_streamer release do not support the -f parameter (for specifying
# the capturing framerate) and will just refuse to output an image if it
# is supplied.
#
# The webcam daemon will detect those devices by their USB Vendor and Product
# ID and remove the -f parameter from the options provided to mjpg_streamer.
#
# By default, this is done for the following devices:
#   Logitech C170 (046d:082b)
#
# Using the following option it is possible to add additional devices. If
# your webcam happens to show above symptoms, try determining your cam's
# vendor and product id via lsusb, activating the line below by removing # and
# adding it as shown examplatory.
#
# If this fixes your problem, please report it back so we can include the device
# out of the box.

# know what you are doing and what the parameters mean.
#
# Below settings are used in the mjpg-streamer call like this:
#
#   -o "output_http.so -w $camera_http_webroot $camera_http_options"
